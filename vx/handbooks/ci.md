## Code audits

QA runs Fallow and React Doctor in parallel with the other checks. Both tools
must meet the configured `minimumScore`; lower or unavailable scores fail the
audit job. Both tools run even if one fails.

See [Code audits](audits.md) for commands, configuration, dependency exceptions,
coverage settings, scores, and reports.
